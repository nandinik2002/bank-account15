Our code asked for three inputs. The inputs were asking for "name", "weekly income", and "the number of weeks worked". The program than took the "weekly income" input and the "number of weeks worked" input and multiplied them together, printing the "accumulated income".
if the user gets a raise, the user will recieve an output of their raise which is 15% of their income.
## Why we chose the Code of Conduct and License we chose
We chose the code of conduct because it was a standard COC which GitHub made.It discusses on making sure to be respectable
and civil when it comes to adding and creating code. The license we chose is what we needed becuase it is  
a short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices.
